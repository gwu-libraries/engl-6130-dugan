Obviously, it depends in part on your definition of \"not unreasonable.\" But it's kind of fun to pick out phrases of length `n+1` (or `n+2`, etc.) from your sample and see if they appear in the original. You can do so by running code like the following. Just edit the part between the quotation marks so that they contain a phrase from your sample.

The novelty of the latest models derives from their capacity to encode overlapping contexts: to represent how the units that make up text occur in multiple relations to each other: e.g., to capture, mathematically, the fact that a certain word frequently follows another word but often appears in the same sentence or paragraph as a third word, and so on. This complexity of representation, coupled with the sheer size of the data used to train the model, leads to Chat-GPT's uncanny ability to mimic textual genres with a high degree of stylistic fidelity.\n", "\n", "", "\n", "", "\n", "But perhaps we do Rabelais' text a disservice by calling it the \"data\" behind our model. We could, just as reasonably, speak of the text itself as the model -- likewise for the tera- or petabytes of text used to train Chat-GPT and its ilk. On Shannon's* theory, language encodes information. The ultimate aim of the theory is to find the most _efficient_ means of encoding (in order to solve \"the engineering problem\" of modern telecommunications networks); nonetheless, the success of the theory implies that any use of language (any use recognizable as such by users of the language) _already_ encodes information. In other words, the transition probabilities we generated from Rabelais' text are already expressed by Rabelais' text; our transition matrix just encodes that information in a more computationally tractable form. Every text encodes its producer's \"knowledge of the statistics of the language\" (in Shannon's* words). And one might argue that every text encodes its readers' knowledge, too. It's on the basis of such knowledge that we can \"decode\" Rabelais' novel, as well as the stochastic quasi-nonsense we can generate on its basis, which feels, relative to the former, like an excess of sense (an excess over and above Rabelais' already excessive text), spilling over the top.\n", "\n", "#### Further experiments\n", "\n", "To see how differences in the source of the model impact the result, try running our code on different texts.

Whether that's an apt description of the human psyche is at least debatable. But might we say that these models manifest the unconscious structures of language itself?
